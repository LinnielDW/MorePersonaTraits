#More Persona Trait Templates
I've included this README as a way for other devs to implement their own weapon persona traits using the things I've found, without having to redo all the research again.

Within the Rimworld codebase, persona traits or link traits are referred to as WeaponTraits. 

It should also be noted that as of writing this (Rimworld 1.3), the only way these traits spawn is on persona weapons.
